                  I got 3rd place globally in Nasser bin Hamad's competition and first place locally. My idea was the Bio Mask, a mask that disintegrates with contact with water. This experience was unforgettable, and I still think of it because I stood next to my idol, and he told me something that I'd never forget to keep doing what I'm doing and representing the country. So far, this achievement is the only reason I'm still here today. This achievement gave me confidence and leadership, as having faith and administration can lead to better decision-making, improved communication, and stronger relationships. It can also help individuals inspire and motivate others, navigate challenges and obstacles, and achieve their goals more effectively.

                I can't be thankful enough for this fantastic opportunity I experienced this past summer. The Global Youth Tourism Summit was a life-changing experience. I was the only male to represent Bahrain in Sorrento, Italy and one of two to represent the country. I was so lucky to work with 160 delegates from over 60 countries and talk about tourism problems and how we, the youth, can fix these problems. I still think about it because it was such an unforgettable journey, and I've developed so much from it. From connections from all around the world to links to high-class people, I've been so fortunate to work with The Ministry of Youth and Sports Affairs and its representative.

            EYE2023 is an event coming soon, and I'm excited to go there because I got accepted as a participant.

I've had so many experiences, and the chance to talk to people was just wonderful. Socializing in itself was just the best part.

          RYLA was a program that taught me teamwork and innovation, which led to cooperation and collaboration and combining diverse skills and perspectives, leading to increased creativity and innovation that can lead to better outcomes and solutions. Additionally, innovative approaches to problem-solving can create a culture of continuous improvement, enabling teams to adapt to changing circumstances and remain competitive. We won 3rd place in the competition against universities where the idea was the Bio Mask.

        I was lucky enough to attend Bahrain's Garden Show at Exhibition World Bahrain, a lot of VIPs were there, and I was so interested in the booths there and how they were unique in their way. I learnt how to present without a script and become more composed when presenting at significant events, which can improve your credibility and increase the audience's confidence in your message, demonstrating a sense of control and professionalism. Additionally, it can help you deliver your message more effectively and ensure that you convey your intended points clearly and persuasively.

        The best experience I could have ever asked for was the MUN Conference of MKMUN. MKMUN was unique and special in its way. I won the "Best Press" award, which made me display my skills to people and have a perfect time at the same time. Photography and video editing were minor skills I developed at the conference. Still, I also got the chance to work with other people, have deadlines to follow, and be punctual, demonstrating reliability and respect for others' time, which can help build trust and positive relationships. It can also help reduce stress and increase productivity by allowing for better time management and planning.

      AHIS hosts its Student Council Elections yearly, so I figured I'd give it a shot and see if I could bring it home. I elected myself as the school's Vice President because that position was the most fitting for that time; this position made me become a leader and taught me the skill of listening to others. Listening to others is a critical component of effective leadership, as it allows leaders to understand the perspectives and needs of their team members, which can lead to better decision-making and more innovative solutions. Additionally, active listening can help build trust and improve communication, fostering a positive and collaborative work environment. Leaders who prioritize listening and value diverse perspectives can inspire their team members and drive better outcomes.

      When I attended the global youth tourism summit, we participated in a workshop that taught us about cruises, specific scenarios, and how to act in that situations. The MSC Foundation hosted this fantastic workshop, and I greatly benefitted from it. Where I learned about cruises and how to tie knots, and the coordinates of a cruise and how to understand it. I also saw how you can park a cruise and how long it takes. The purpose of workshops is to provide a hands-on learning experience for participants to acquire new knowledge, skills, and techniques in a specific area of interest. Workshops can also facilitate team building, problem-solving, and idea generation among participants.    </p>

    After realizing our potential in Injaz CP, my colleague and I decided to participate in other competitions and see how far we could make it with this idea. Our school houses Bahrain Young Entrepreneurs (BYE) competition, where you showcase the best ideas a person can come up with. When we participated, we were delighted to show the school our vision because we knew from the start that people would like it. We qualified for the finals and presented in front of VIPs from the biggest companies in Bahrain. We won 2 prizes; the first was "The Best Product Award," and the second was "The Best Project in Highschool." We were thrilled to reach such a high milestone and honoured to present in front of these people.

I was always so nervous with such a weak character, but being selected showed me that I'm a better version of the person I was before. Participating in many extracurricular activities can benefit you by helping you develop new skills, make new friends, and gain valuable experiences outside of the classroom. It can also boost your confidence, improve your time management skills, and demonstrate your commitment to your passions and interests.

    ARKISMUN was one of the best MUN Conferences I have ever been to, and I was more than happy when I got accepted to the team and thrilled to work with the others aswell. ARKIS has taught me a lot, and this comes from one specific reason when I was nominated for "Best Press" Unfortunately, I didn't get the award, but that taught me something which is not winning something can teach you that success is not guaranteed and that there are valuable lessons that teach you from failure. It can also help you develop resilience, persistence, and a stronger desire to improve and succeed. I've also realized I could earn this award shortly, but other awards like GYTS and Sheikh Nasser's won't return Bestever "again, which made me so thankful.
